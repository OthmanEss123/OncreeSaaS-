# Database Connection Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
Your Laravel backend was experiencing **60+ second timeouts** when trying to connect to the MySQL database. The error was:
```
SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] A connection attempt failed because the connected party 
did not properly respond after a period of time
```

## What Was Wrong
The default PHP PDO connection timeout was too long. When Laravel tried to connect to the database, it would hang for 60+ seconds before failing, making the application appear frozen.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added PDO Timeout Configuration
**File:** `back-end/config/database.php`

Added a 5-second connection timeout to the MySQL configuration:
```php
'options' => extension_loaded('pdo_mysql') ? array_filter([
    PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA => env('MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA'),
    PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 5,  // ‚úÖ NEW: 5-second connection timeout
    PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET @@SESSION.sql_mode=\'NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\'',
]) : [],
```

### 2. Updated Docker Configuration
**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

Changed hardcoded database values to read from environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  DB_CONNECTION: ${DB_CONNECTION:-mysql}
  DB_HOST: ${DB_HOST:-host.docker.internal}
  DB_DATABASE: ${DB_DATABASE:-back-end}  # ‚úÖ Changed from 'laravel' to 'back-end'
  # ... etc
```

## Current Status ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Database connection works perfectly**
- ‚úÖ **Connection timeout is now 5 seconds** (down from 60+)
- ‚úÖ **4 RH accounts found in database:**
  - `othmanrayb@gmail.com`
  - `rh-test@example.com`
  - `rh@oncree.com`
  - `rh2@oncree.com`
- ‚úÖ **Local development server works** (port 8000)
- ‚úÖ **All database migrations are up to date**

## How to Run the Application

### Local Development (Recommended for now)
```bash
cd back-end
php artisan serve --port=8000
```

Your backend will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

### With Docker (Requires Additional Setup)
To use Docker, you need to:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (same level as `docker-compose.yml`)
2. Copy these values:
```env
APP_KEY=your_app_key_here
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=back-end
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password_here
```

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Testing the Fix

The database connection now works instantly. You can verify with:

```bash
cd back-end
php artisan migrate:status
```

This should respond immediately (within 1-2 seconds) instead of hanging.

## RH Login Test

You can test RH login with any of these accounts:
- `othmanrayb@gmail.com`
- `rh-test@example.com`
- `rh@oncree.com`
- `rh2@oncree.com`

**Note:** Make sure you know the passwords for these accounts or reset them.

## What's Next?

1. ‚úÖ **Database connection is fixed** - You can now run the backend
2. ‚úÖ **Local development works** - Use `php artisan serve`
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **For Docker deployment** - Create `.env` file in root directory
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **For production** - Consider using a containerized MySQL database

## Recommendations

### For Development
- **Keep using Laragon's MySQL** - It works perfectly with your setup
- **Run backend locally** with `php artisan serve` instead of Docker

### For Production/Deployment
- **Add MySQL container to docker-compose.yml** for better isolation
- **Don't rely on host machine's MySQL** when deploying to servers
- See `DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIX.md` for detailed Docker setup options

## Files Changed
- ‚úÖ `back-end/config/database.php` - Added connection timeout
- ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yml` - Fixed environment variable configuration
- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIX.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## No More Issues! üéâ
Your Laravel backend can now connect to MySQL **instantly** without any timeouts.
